<p align="center"> <img src="fig1.pdf" width="90%"> </p>

# 🔍 Overview
This repository contains the official resources for the paper: “Toward a Training-Free Plug-and-play Refinement Framework for Infrared and Visible Image Registration and Fusion”. We propose TRACE, a Training-free Reinforcement-based Alignment method for Cross-modality Enhancement, which incorparates Evaluator, a rewarding network, into an evaluation-driven Reinforcement Learning(RL) framework, enabling efficient and plug-and-play refinement of any existing registration approach.
## 📝 TODO List
